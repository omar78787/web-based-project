<h1> Lesson 1: Introduction to C++</h1>
<h3> Overview</h3>
<p>C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language that combines object-oriented, procedural, and generic programming features. Originally developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983 as an enhancement to C, C++ has become widely used for system/software development, game development, and real-time systems.</p>
    <h3> Key Features of C++</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Object-Oriented: Supports classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.</li>
         <li> Low-Level Manipulation: Retains the low-level control of C with added features.  </li>
           <li> Rich Library Support: Extensive libraries for various purposes, including the Standard Template Library (STL).</li>
            <li>Portability: Programs written in C++ are platform-independent, requiring only recompilation on a new platform.</li>
            <li>Performance: Optimized for high-performance applications.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3> Why Learn C++?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>It is foundational for understanding other programming languages.</li>
         <li> C++ is used in industries like game development, financial modeling, and operating system development. </li>
           <li> It balances the speed and efficiency of C with advanced features like templates and exception handling.
        </li></ol>
<h3> First Code Example In C++:</h3>
<p style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color:white;">
    #include <iostream>

        int main() {
          <br>  // Declare variables
          <br>     int age = 30;
          <br>        double salary = 75000.50;
            <br>     char grade = 'A';
            <br>   bool isEmployed = true;
        
            <br>     // Display values
            <br>     std::cout << "Age: " << age << std::endl;
            <br>         std::cout << "Salary: $" << salary << std::endl;
            <br>   std::cout << "Grade: " << grade << std::endl;
            <br>      std::cout << "Employed: " << (isEmployed ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;
        
            return 0;
        }
        
    </p>
 <h3> Output: </h3>
 <p style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color:white;">
    Age: 30
    Salary: $75000.5
    Grade: A
    Employed: Yes
    </p>

    <h3>Notes: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Every C++ program starts with a main function.</li>
        <li>Use std::cout and std::cin for basic input/output.</li>
        <li>Use comments using // to make your code easier to understand.</li>
        <li>There is a way to make it so you don't need to type std:: but it's bad practice</li>
    </ol>
